"""Start node -- marks an execution entry point.

A `StartNode` has no inputs and one `trigger` output. It does no work at
runtime; its only purpose is to declare that the connected component
containing it is "live" and should be executed. Connect the trigger output
to a data-root node (e.g. Dataset) to mark that node as an entry point.
